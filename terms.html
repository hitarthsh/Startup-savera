              <p>
                Cookies serve various functions, such as enabling seamless
                navigation between web pages, remembering visitor preferences,
                and enhancing the overall browsing experience. They may also
                help ensure that online advertisements are relevant to users’
                interests. We use cookies for multiple reasons, including
                identifying popular features, counting visitors, improving
                user experience, maintaining security, and providing a better
                service.

                Startup Savera Services may use cookie data to analyze user
